### Hi, I'm Tony!

I am a full time student at Purdue University, studying computer science. I like to organize Hackathon, play Cities Skyline, Apex and watch F1 in my down time.<br/>
I am skilled in Java, C, ReactJs, JavaScript, Swift, SQL, Python, C++, .NET Core, and AngularJS.


### My Recent Projects

- [My Personal Website](https://chen2886.github.io)
   - I recently had some free time, so I decided to make my own personal website using React.
- [C-City](https://devpost.com/software/c-city)
   - I participated in BoilerMake 8, and my team won 3rd place over all. This app recommends where one should move based on preferences inputted.
- [StarStats](https://github.com/BrawlStats-Purdue/BrawlStats)
   - StarStats is an iOS app I made with a team that tracks the statistics of a BrawlStar player. This app won best design award from CodePath.
